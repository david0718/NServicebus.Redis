NServicebus.Redis
=================

NServicebus.Redis is a addon to bring Redis style goodness to NServicebus. 

At the moment this code is alpha level, the focus is to have sending and reciving messages via a redis transport complete. Then look towards implementing subscription, saga and timeout storage.
