NServicebus.Redis
=================

NServicebus.Redis is a addon to bring Redis style goodness to NServicebus. 

At the moment this code is beta level but working implementations exist for the queue transport and persistence for timeouts, sagas and subscriptions. 
Transaction support is implemented but probably needs proper testing and some sanity checking. The queue implementation should be very robust though.
